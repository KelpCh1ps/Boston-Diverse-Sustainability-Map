## 📌 Inspiration

This project is inspired by food insecurity and unequal access to food resources across the Greater Boston area. Many communities struggle to find clear, centralized, and up-to-date information about where food assistance is available.

We wanted to build a tool that makes food resources more visible, accessible, and equitable.

## 🗺️ What It Does

The Boston Diverse Sustainability Map:

- Maps food banks and food assistance resources across Greater Boston  
- Allows users to quickly find food resources near them  
- Displays different resource types in interactive map layers  
- Helps communities identify areas where support may be missing  
- Uses AI-generated summaries to provide real-time updates and reviews about locations  

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It

We built this project using:

- Public Data from Boston Public Data  
- Google Places API to locate food distributors  
- Cleaned and standardized exported results into structured JSON format  
- Displayed the data on an interactive map with layers for different resource types  
- Integrated the Gemini API to generate real-time updates and review summaries  

The focus was on creating clean, standardized, and maintainable data pipelines that connect open data to a responsive mapping interface.

## ⚡ Challenges We Ran Into

- **Limited Public Data:** Many relevant food resource datasets were incomplete or not publicly available.  
- **Data Cleaning & Standardization:** Combining multiple sources into consistent JSON structures required significant effort.  
- **Gemini API Integration:** Implementing real-time AI-generated summaries based on location data presented technical challenges.
